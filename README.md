# Pokenjos

Pretty simple to explain: I wanted to code a little fun game for my friends.
I wanted to start exploring the ROM of Pokemon Red, but I need a first step in the world
of pokemon, so I started by making my own version of pokemon before reading the sourcecode.

This is not a serious project, just a fun project to learn a bit about the game mechanics.

My goal is also to play Pokemon online with my friends, so if you want to download to 
play with yours, feel free to do so.


I will probably change pokemon names, types, moves, and other things to make it more fun for me.
